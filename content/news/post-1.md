Dear FTV members,

On Tuesday 07th of July 2020, we welcomed our first quarterly Tech Talk at Sofitel with overwhelming interest and over-registration to the last minute!

We are thrilled to have a full house of both Tech ethusiasts and Healthcare professionals who join our speakers and panelists on the topic: HealthTech, Current Stage of Technology Application in Vietnam’s Healthcare Industry.

This blend of Tech start-ups and Healthcare players, both from the side of speakers, panelists and guests, allowed a unique sharing session with insightful questions and answers.  We are also happy to see that our attendees made meaningful industry contacts through the networking session.  That made all our organization effort worthwhile!
